WHAT WOULD I LIKE TO DO, but need approval or consult
1. Uniqueness of Levels:
    Implement a check to ensure that levels are unique before adding them.
    This needs to be done carefully, as the first value can only be added once,
    given that there are no levels that are duplicated.
    I applied this logic only in the remove element function,
    but I am now reconsidering if it's the right decision.
2. Value Representation:
    Currently, the value is a Vec<u8> representing a string in bytes.
    I would like to change this to an entry element from the hel structures,
    allowing for both logical and physical deletion.

QUESTIONS
1. Bounds Handling:
    Currently, the first and last elements act as bounds.
    This means you cannot add keys beyond their existence or remove
    values associated with those keys. Should this behavior be changed?
